# VPN and Remote Desktop Connection



## Overview of VPN

What is a VPN? VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. This is a mechanism for creating a secure connection between your user computer and the server network.&#x20;

The VPN is a recent addition to add an extra level of security to the information that is stored in the software database.

To now connect to the Remote Desktop Connection, users will need to enable their VPN first. The following steps will walk through how to turn on and turn off your VPN.&#x20;



### Enabling and Disabling Your VPN



#### Enabling the VPN

1. To enable your VPN, you will open your VPN icon.&#x20;

    Once you are connected on the VPN, you can then access the RDP connection. For directions on connecting to the RDP connection, click [here](vpn-and-remote-desktop-connection.md#overview-of-remote-desktop-connection).&#x20;



### Disabling the VPN

When you have completed your session in the remote desktop, you will want to turn off your VPN. This is done by hitting the same button that turned the VPN on.&#x20;

The VPN will ask you to confirm the disconnection.&#x20;

**It is important to note, the steps with the VPN will need to be done before and after every remote connection is made. If you do not turn on the VPN before trying to connect to the Remote Desktop, the connection will not load and you will not be able to log in.**&#x20;
