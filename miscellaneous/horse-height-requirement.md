# Horse Height Requirement

In the class detail, users are able to set a Horse Type (S/M/L pony, S/L horse) OR set a height range for Horse Height. **Please note that ONLY ONE of these preferences can be set per class.**

As with existing requirements, the user may select “warn” to warn a user that the horse does not fit the requirements to be in the class or select “disallow” which will produce an error message and will not allow the entry to be added if it is outside of the requirements.
