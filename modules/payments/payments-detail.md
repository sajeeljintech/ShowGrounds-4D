Users can input the date they want the transaction to be recorded on, the reference number and the memo.

They can input the amount that was paid with the amount box.

If the payment was made through a web portal, users can check the “Web Payment” box.

Users can also reverse the selected transaction. The following message will appear asking the user to confirm they want to reverse the transaction ONLY if the transaction is being reversed on the same day it was made. If it is NOT the same day the transaction was created, the user will have to refund the payment as it has already been batched.

## Voiding/Refunding Payments

When you do a credit card transaction and need to “undo” it there are two scenarios.  If it’s the same day, then this is considered a “void.” If it’s after the day of the transaction, then it is usually “batched” and you need to “refund” the payment.   Both are done very similarly in our system.

Voiding/Refunding

1\) Open Payments module and find the payment. You can use the search tool for this.

2\) Open the individual Payment which will look  like this.

3\) In this case the payment has been batched and has to be refunded.  Simply click the “Refund Transaction” button. This will create a duplicate “negative” payment for the same amount against the same card.

———–

PLEASE NOTE – It’s critically important that you don’t delete payments.  There is always an option to “reverse” the payment or in the case of credit cards “refund.”
