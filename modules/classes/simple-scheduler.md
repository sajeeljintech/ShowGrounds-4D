# Simple Scheduler

## Simple Scheduler

The simple scheduler is a tool that allows the horse show to share estimated class times on the web based on numbers of horses in classes and other customizable settings. These times will update in real time on the web as horses are added or dropped. Once the horse show begins, actual times are made available immediately to exhibitors on the web as the announcer, in-gate person or manager ticks off rounds as they go in the announcer interface (on the wheel in the class window under the in-gate and announcer tab).

## **Setting up the Simple Scheduler**

Open the Simple Scheduler by selecting the Class module. Under the wheel, select Simple Scheduler.

If it is a multi ring, multi day horse show, select the ring and day you wish to schedule. Begin by selecting the planned start-up time for the ring. Begin adding classes in the order they appear on the time schedule.

Simply type in the class number and how many minutes per trip you estimate each course will take to complete if it is a jumping class. If a flat or Under Saddle class, click the “trips go all at once” and estimate the amount of time the class will take to complete. If it is a group of the same classes (multiple jumping classes being run concurrently), put all of the class numbers together in the classes box, separated by commas. The name of the class will auto fill but can be changed to suit your needs.

If you need “padding” of times, you can put some time into the “class set up time” box. Once it is ready to insert, click the ADD button. This will put the classes into the schedule above. When complete, the window will look something like this:

## Adding Breaks

Adding breaks into the schedule is done by selecting the “Info Class” button.

Once the user has selected the “Info Class” button, they need to input the following information:

The name of the break they are adding.

The planned start time of the break.

The break duration (this time is in minutes).

Once the info is entered, select the add button and the break will be input into the schedule and will show highlighted in yellow.

### Setting Default Trip Times

You can now change the default trip time in system preferences.

By default, the trip time for an over fences trip will be 3 minutes, and a flat class will be 15 minutes.

To change the default times and override the 3 & 15 minute defaults, go to System Preferences.

Under the additional tab the default class signup settings can be found.

From here, you can change the default minutes per trip for fence classes and flat classes.

Once you have updated your changes, be sure to hit the save button and the changes will be saved and override the default times.
