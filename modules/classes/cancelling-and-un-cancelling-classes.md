# Cancelling and Un-cancelling Classes

Once your schedule has been set, if you have classes that need to be cancelled, this is easily done.&#x20;

Open your simple scheduler and select the correct date and ring.

Your list of classes will show scheduled.&#x20;

Select your desired class so it is highlighted.&#x20;

Down at the bottom of the page, the class information is populated. There are 3 buttons where you can either Save, Delete, or Cancel Group. To cancel the class you will click that Cancel Group button.&#x20;

Once you have clicked that button, the system will ask if you are sure you want to cancel. Click ok to continue.&#x20;

Once your class has been cancelled, if you want to un-cancel, you will follow the same directions as cancelling a class. Only now, when you highlight the cancelled class, the button will show as Un-cancel.

If you click that button, the system will ask if you are sure you want to Un-cancel the group.

Click ok to continue, and your class will be un-cancelled. Any changes made in the scheduler, you need to hit the save button before closing out.&#x20;
