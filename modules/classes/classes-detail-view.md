Class number – The class number can be any value but must NOT have any letters as part of it.  If you need to change a class number after having saved it you must first click the “Lock” icon to unlock the field for editing.

### USHJA Qualifier Class

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/img\_612e79286e82d.png)

If you have a class that is operating as either “Ranking List” or “Young Jumper Qualifier” you must check the box to enable the USHJA Qualifier.  Once you’ve done so select which type of qualifier the class is part of.  You also enter the class number to be used for the qualifier.  This class number will be used in the results file sent to USEF.  It must not be the same as any other class in the show.  Results of the main class will be reported in the Qualifier class as well.  In this example the main class is 806 and the results will be reported for that class as well as for class 999 (the qualifier class.)

### Classes With Multiple Jump Heights Offered&#x20;

\*Please note this is ONLY for classes that offer multiple jump heights. This is NOT applicable to combined classes. For combined classes, please use the combine feature.

As pictured below, the there are two relevant fields for jump height - "Fence Height" and "Heights".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (120).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the “fence height” field, you may enter one of the jump heights offered for the class. This will be the default if no specific height is selected for the entry. In order to indicate that the class is to be run at multiple heights, the user should enter the heights in the “heights” field in INCHES ONLY separated by commas in the new field as seen above. For example, a class that is to run at 2’9 and 3’ MUST be entered in the new field as follows: “33, 36”.

&#x20;“2’9, 3’” would NOT be a valid entry.

The user should then navigate to the class in question. In the entries tab, upon clicking on the fence height field, the user will see a drop down for each entry. To continue with the example above, the dropdown will have the options of “33, 36” to indicate which height that entry will jump. Select the correct height for each entry.
