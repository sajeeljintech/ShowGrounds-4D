**NOTE**: The entry verification process will use the **original class rules** for the combined classes. USEF Results for Combined Class now shows the Fence Height from the original Class.

In the IOS app and on the Web, when adding entries and doing a class add/drop, we are not allowing the users to enter into the current combined class or division. They can only enter in the original class/division.

This option can be used to import classes from previous shows into the currently selected show. First, make sure that you are in the show you want to import the classes INTO from a previous show, and then select the quick action.

A dialog box will appear where the user can select the show from which the classes will be imported from.

There are three ways to select the classes the user wants to import.

* Enter the classes by class number in the search bar under the Source Show
* If the user wants all of the classes from the Source Show then select the Select All Classes option
* Selecting the classes individually by checking the boxes on the left hand side column.

Once the classes are selected that the user wants to import, select Import.

### Notes about Imported Classes

1. After classes are imported from another show the class in the current show will note in the history that it was imported form another show.
2. Classes are imported with the same class number. In the case of a conflicting class number, the next highest available class number will be assigned to the class.
3. Class requirements, class rules, and class prize templates are all included with the information that is imported.
4. Combined classes are imported as Non-Combined classes. No class groups are created with the imported classes.
5. Imported classes are assigned ONLY to the same division in the show process.
