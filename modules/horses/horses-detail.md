### Membership Status

The Horse Status is computed from fields of information automatically, however if there is an existing override for the governing organization then the status will use the values that the user enters into the override.

To override a Horse’s status, from the Entry select the field of which you wish to override and double click. (EC, USEF, FEI etc)

The override dialog box will appear and then you can update the Horse’s status.

**\*\*\*NOTE: You MUST add a reason or the record will not save.**

Once you have saved the override, if you open the Classes tab in the Entry, the override will be noted by the status showing in yellow. This indicates that either the horse, rider, or both were modified using the Temporary Override tool.
