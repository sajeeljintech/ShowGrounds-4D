## Merge Records

If a Show Company has more than one record for the same entry, they may Merge them. NOTE\*\*\*This action cannot be reversed, so it should be used carefully.

First, lookup the records that are for the entry, and CLICK ONCE on the one that you want all records to be merged into. It will show highlighted in blue.

1. **Bank Accoun**t – This has to be the exact name of the checking account used to write prize money checks.  If in Quickbooks your account is called “Bank of America Checking 1234” then you would enter exactly that name.
2. **Prize Money Account**– This is the expense account in Quickbooks that is used for your Prize Money.  Again type this name exactly.
3. **Refund Account**– This is the account used to log any refunds for overpayments.  This might be the income account you use for show sales or another account that is used to track refunds.  Again the name must be entered exactly.
