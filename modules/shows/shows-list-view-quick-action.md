During the verification process we may get either “Warnings” or “Errors”. Warnings may be fixed prior to submission of results but they won’t cause the upload process to fail. Errors on the other hand will prevent the results from being uploaded until they are resolved. Some of the things we verify before submitting results includes

* Rider Name Missing in Entry
* Entry Horse Missing in Entry
* Class Competition Code Missing in Class

All errors will be displayed in the Upload Results Summary area. If there are no errors, errors list is empty as show in figure below. Users have the option to export the result errors in the excel file by clicking on the â€œExport Errors button. This provides a mechanism to have a working list of the items needing to be fixed before returning to attempt uploading the results again.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Shows List View - Quick Action12.png>)

If there are no errors during the results upload, we check for warnings. If there are warnings during the results upload process, the user is notified about the warnings and asked to continue with results upload to FEI database or cancel the results upload, as shown in figure below.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Shows List View - Quick Action13.png>)

If user clicks cancel, user can export the warning messages to a text file to review and fix the issues.

If user clicks OK button, results are submitted to the FEI database. If results are submitted successfully to the FEI database, a success message is displayed to the user, as shown in figure below.

## Move Entries to Show

We added a feature for moving entries from a show to another.  This is a complex feature and we STRONGLY advise using it with caution.  This feature moves all aspects of the entry from one show to another, when completed the entry will no longer be in the original show at all.  This feature only works to move entries where all aspects of the show setup are identical including Fees, Classes

Highlight the **destination show** from the shows list to which user wants to move entries. To move entries, select quick action ‘Move Entries to Show’.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Shows List View - Quick Action15.png>)

From show selection dialog, select the source show from which user wants to import entries.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Shows List View - Quick Action16.png>)

In next step, if there are some missing classes, divisions and show fees in destination show then we display the errors in move entries verification step and user cannot proceed with the move entries to show process without fixing those errors.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img\_602688c3b55b6.png)

If there are no errors, then the user can click on ‘Move Entries’ button. _\*\*Please note that moving entries involves records from two different shows. If any records related to an entry is locked by another user that entry, and its related records, are ignored and the user will have to run the process again later._

After entry move, entry is marked as moved from show by adding message in change history.

### Important Notes Regarding EC Results Submissions

1. Show are identified through the EC Event ID which should be a valid show number from EC database for the Event to be recognized correctly by EC.
2. The Show Company must have the correct EC information in classes which is used for identification of EC competitions in the show. The Show Company must provide the EC Section Code, EC Class Type, and EC Sanction Level in EC classes
