This portion of the detail screen will be viewable from each tab, showing the Show Name, Show Dates, and Facility Information. It also will show you whether or not the show has been published on the web. \*\*Note: If you need to update your show name or dates, you need to reach out to [support@showgroundsonline.com](mailto:support@showgroundsonline.com) with that request.

### Requiring Stalls for Show Entry

Show companies can require that entries have a stall to be able to enter a show. There is a checkbox in the General tab of the Show for _Require Entry Stall._&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Requiring Stalls for Show Entry1.png>)

On the Master Fee record, make sure that _Stabling Fee_ and _Available for Web Ordering_ options are selected for the stall fee. To read more about Master Fees click [here.](../master-fees/master-fees.md)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Requiring Stalls for Show Entry2.png>)

When the stall fee (or any fee that has _Stabling Fee_ checkbox enabled) is added in the entry the option to select _Trainer Stall Inventory\*_ appears. This will need to be checked within the trainer account so that the quantity of the fee will be considered as available stall inventory to use in the web entries. \*\*Note: This will only be available IF the entry is linked to a trainer account.\*\*

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Requiring Stalls for Show Entry3.png>)

### Exhibitor View on the Web

Once the entries are added online, the stall quantity will be checked for within the trainer account of the selected trainer and matched with the trainer’s entries. If the inventory is not available, then the user will receive a stop in the _Review Fees_ step.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Exhibitor View on the Web1.png>)

If the entry is being entered across multiple shows that require a stall, it will look like the following. The dollar amount listed will be automatically charged once the entry is completed.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/shows-listview-3.png)

### In the Show Office

Entries can either have stalls added from their trainer account or they can add a stabling fee. This means that the entry will either A) Utilize a stall from the trainer’s available inventory or B) add the stall to the entry for them to meet the requirement of having a stall. \*\*NOTE: In the _Show Fee_ record, be sure to set an inventory cap for stalls to ensure that the stalls are not over sold.

If an entry is being added in the show office, users will see a notification on the bottom of the screen notating whether the stall they are assigning to the entry is going to be coming from a trainer’s inventory or not. They will also see the remaining inventory for that trainer account.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/In the Show Office1.png>)

If the entry is not associated with a trainer and/or no stall has been added, users will not be able to continue with the entry process.
