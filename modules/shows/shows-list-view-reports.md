## 1099 Show Summary Report

The 1099 report is a report of all people that received $600 or more in prize money in the year selected. The people that are on this report have either 1) won and received their prize money – ether as a credit to their balance or in the form of a check – or 2) they won and are owed the money but it was never paid to them because the show company is missing the required information; This report should only reflect the parties who have received the money, because if they have not received it then the show company is still responsible for getting them that money.

The 1099 reports can be found under the “print” button on the Shows Module.

1099 Reports look for Prize Money payment records applied to the entry during the year and only include those in the report.  If the payment to RTO is made in the next year, it will be reflected in that year’s 1099.
