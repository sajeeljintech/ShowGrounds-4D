# Entries List View

## Overview

The list view for the entries module allows you to see and filter the entries.   You also can print reports relevant to entries and perform other functions from the list view.  This page will review all those options.

## List View General Functionality

Many of the basic features of our list views for any module are the same.  [**Please take a look at this article for an overview**](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/documentation/list-views-overview/).

## Top Row Buttons

### Search Button

The search bar on the bottom allows the user to search for one thing at a time, but if the user wants to do a more detailed search then they can double click the top search button.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/img\_615365b245132.png)

A dialog box will open with an array of search options.

**Note,** the user can now search for temporarily overridden entries in the membership section.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/img\_6234935c2285f.png)

Once the user has entered in the desired criteria and selects search, any Entries in that show that match the search will be shown on the list view.

To get back to the entry list of entries, select ALL from the top row of buttons.

### All Button

The All button is used when the user has a list view of entries that has been refined by a search. Selecting ALL will take the user back to a list of all of the entries for that show.

### Add Button

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/img\_615362d0212ed.png)

This enables the user to add an Entry to the show. \*\*NOTE: At the top of the list view, the show is named to ensure the user is adding the entry into the desired show.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/img\_6153631859a51.png)

When the Add button is selected, a blank entry detail screen appears.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/img\_6153634c6992e.png)

Under any of the options (Horse, Rider, Trainer, Stable) the user can type in a name, and hit enter, and a dialog box with options from that search for the entry will appear.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/img\_615363cce48f8.png)

^In this case, if the desired horse is on the list, selected, and the user hits the enter key, the information on file for that Entry will automatically be filled in.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/img\_615364286bd60.png)

The user can then SAVE the entry.

If the Horse (in this case) is NOT not on the list of options for the entry, then the user can select the option to Add New

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/img\_615364ab49047.png)

The user will then manually have to input the entry information and then SAVE when completed.

### **Print**

### Quick Search

### Delete

You may use this button to delete selected entries if you have Administration status. \*\*\*NOTE: This action is not reversible.

### Verification

The verification tool allows the user to search through a list of selected entries, or all on screen, and run a verification of membership. The button can be found on the top of the List View screen.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/img\_613232cde36ff.png)

Click on the button and then you will get a drop down with options. Select _Verify Entries._&#x20;

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/img\_613232f103b0d.png)

A dialog box will appear with options for verification. Select your choices and then select Continue.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/img\_61322adb1b3ee.png)

On the entry List View on the far left hand side, once the verification is done, there will be a series of red or green markers indicating whether the entry is in fact verified or not.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/img\_6132338253488.png)

If you scroll to the right, you can view the Verification Status column

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/img\_613233bd8d819.png)

If you go back up to the Verification Button to the drop down, you can select to view only the Verified or Unverified Entries. You can also select “Clear Verification Results” which will reset the verifications back to the original list view of entries.

## Find Entries

As with all modules there are several ways to find the records you need. Each of these is listed here.

### Search Bar

![](../../.gitbook/assets/show2.png)

In entries the search bar will search the following fields.

* Entry Number
* Horse Name
* Rider Name
* Owner Name
* Trainer Name
* Stable/Barn Name

When only numbers or numbers plus a “-” are given then only the entry number is searched.

_**Example**_: searching for “100” will find an entry with back number 100 only.  Searching for 100-110 will find all entries with back numbers in the range of 100 through 110.

All searches containing letters will be used to search the other fields and will be treated as a contains search.

_**Example**_: searching for “Bert” will find entries with any person who has first names _Bert_ or Ro_bert_ as well as entries with any person with last name Ro_bert_ or Ro_bert_son

## “Refine” Option

The _Refine_ option in the search bar at the bottom of the entries window will narrow the search results by searching in the current selection.
