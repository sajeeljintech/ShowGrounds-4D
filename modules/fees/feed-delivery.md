# Feed Delivery

## Overview

The feed delivery system is designed to allow exhibitors to orders supplies online and facility the delivery of those supplies to the customer. When the process is completed the customer will receive delivery confirmation via SMS.

## Setup in ShowGrounds

To setup this system there are a few things that must be done.

> IMPORTANT: Your show company must be a subscriber to the ShowGrounds texting service so notifications can be sent to the customer. If you are not sure if you have this service please contact support@showgroundsonline.com

### Step 1: Associate each item you will deliver with a Master fee.

Ensure each item you will be delivering is associated with a “Master Fee” record. You can do this by editing the fee record and verifying that a master fee record is selected.

### Step 2: Open the Master fee records and check off the “Physical Delivery” check box.

This enables the item to be used in the delivery system on the web.

## Adding Fees in ShowGrounds

Once your items are setup you can add fees in the ShowGrounds client for an entry as you would any fee. For items that require physical delivery you will be prompted for a barn and stall location to deliver to as well as the customers phone number to text when the order is delivered.

## Viewing a Fee in ShowGrounds

You may double click a fee record that has delivery defined for it and see the status of the delivery. Simply double click the fee record to view.

You’ll notice the “Order Delivery” section at the bottom which will have current status, delivery location, etc.

## Undeliver Option

On the fee detail dialog, there is a button option to “Undeliver Item”. This clears the delivery info and sets the item as un-delivered. Also adds a log line.

## Processing Orders on the Web

Any person that is going to be responsible for delivering supplies to customers must first have a showgroundslive.com login. If they have not done so already ask them to register for a login. Once they have you can add them to the group that provides access to the feed delivery system. If you are unfamiliar with this process please contact support@showgroundsonline.com

Once a user is registered and added to the correct group they may login at your showgroundslive.com site. For instance showgroundslive.com/xyz (where xyz is your show company)

For the use to access orders they can login and they should be able to click on the “Admin” link at the top of the left hand navigations

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/img\_61118db235d81.png)

They will find the link to the delivery tool under “Show Administration”

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/img\_61118e1e3e16e.png)

Once at this address they user may wish to bookmark the site and or save a shortcut to their home screen.

## Processing Orders

Once the user is in the delivery tool they will see all pending items. They can view items by Category or by Entry. This allows them to either delivery a type of product or delivery all products for a single order.

When listing items by Entry, the trainer’s name will appear:

### Check in Date & Time and Selecting Barn Types

We have added some new features to our feed delivery system. We have now made a field for pre orders with a check in date and time, the trainer’s name, the delivery notification phone number, and the barn & stall location. The barn, stall, & trainer fields are mandatory and users cannot proceed without filling this information in. \*\***Note:** If you set pre-orders the barn will not be required due to the exhibitor not having their stabling assignment yet.\*\*

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img\_62b4902be4162.png)

We have also added a backend list for barn types to control options for a show company. You can limit the options for barns available for a specific show using a new admin tool which can be accessed from admin site menu Company Admin ➝ Feed Delivery Shows.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img\_62b485daac22d.png)

Admins can set the barn types and pre-order cutoff date and time for a show by using the edit button next to the desired show.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img\_62b4862f795a4.png)

The checked barns will appear as a selectable option for exhibitors when signing up. If you do not select any barns in a show then all barn types will be displayed in the barn list dropdown menu on the add entry and order supplies tabs during the entry process.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img\_62b486909395d.png)

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img\_62b4879504858.png)

Orders are considered as a pre-order only based on the pre-order cut off date & time set for a show. **All orders for shows with missing pre-order cut off datetime are not considered pre-orders.**

_**\*\*Note\*\*** If you would like to utilize this feature, please reach out to support with your listing of barns._

### Feed Delivery Update to Search Feature

We now offer the ability to search by trainer name. Previously, the trainer account number was needed to search for a trainer but now users can search by name.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img\_62b48a6b7a5a6.png)

We have also added a drop down menu to allow you to select how many orders are shown on a page: 25, 50 or 100.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img\_62b48c3e51872.png)

You can also now search by barn IF you have provided the barn information to ShowGrounds. You can email us this information at _support@showgroundsonline.com_

### Marking an Order as a Priority Order

We now offer the ability to set an order as high priority. This is done through the entry on the fee detail where there is a checkbox to indicate a high priority order.

![](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/img\_62b48b9d00368.png)

We have also updated the list of orders in the admin tool so that by default, oldest orders are shown at the top. If there are priority orders, they will be at the top of the list in the admin tool and the priority orders are highlighted in red.
