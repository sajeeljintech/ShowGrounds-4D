# Users List View

## Overview

The list view for the Users module allows you to see and filter the Users in your database.   This is where you define who can access the database using the ShowGrounds Client and based on what [Groups](../groups/) they are apart of define what permissions each user has.  Read more on [Groups](../groups/) and permissions to learn more. You also can print reports relevant to \_\_\_\_\_\_ and perform other functions from the list view.  This page will review all those options.

## List View General Functionality

Many of the basic features of our list views for any module are the same.  [**Please take a look at this article for an overview**](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/documentation/list-views-overview/).
