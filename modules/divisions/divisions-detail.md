The general tab holds information such as the type of division (Jumper, hunter, equitation or dressage), the division rating, the price for the division and the USEF/EC section code.

You can also change the division name at the top of the detail view.

You can select if you are offering champion based on prize money, or no champion/reserve champion awarded for the division.

We now warn users if the division price is higher than the sum total of the classes in the division. Previously you could not proceed with saving, now you receive a warning message and can proceed with save.

### Champion/Reserve tab

The lower columns will show the champion & reserve champions for the division based off the point summary.

You can manually add the champion and reserve by using the Add entry # box at the bottom and selecting the appropriate placing for the entry number.

### Point Summary Tab

The Point Summary tab will show you a breakdown of the points for all of the classes associated with the division by showing you the entry number, and how they placed in the class. The classes are broken out by fence classes first, and then the flat class is the last column if there is a flat class with the division. The O/F sub column shows the combined points from the over fences classes only. The last column is the total points from the fences and flat classes combined.

The recalculate button will recalculate the point summary page if there has been a change in the results and the class has been verified.

This popup will appear before you are able to recalculate the points.
