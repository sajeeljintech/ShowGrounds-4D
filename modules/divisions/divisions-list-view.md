## Overview

The list view for the Divisions module allows you to see and filter the Divisions in your database.  You also can print reports relevant to Divisions and perform other functions from the list view. This page will review all those options.

## List View General Functionality

Many of the basic features of our list views for any module are the same.  [**Please take a look at this article for an overview**](http://docs.showgroundsonline.com/documentation/list-views-overview/).

## Find Divisions

As with all modules there are several ways to find the records you need. Each of these is listed here.

### Search Bar

In Divisions, the search bar will search the following fields.

* Division Number
* Divisions Name

## Combing & Splitting Divisions

Show companies will be able to combine selected classes and/or divisions. If the user selects one or more division then it will combine and set up the interface for them. There will be a red message on the bottom of the screen confirming that the divisions are going to be combined.

Once combined, it will show in the division module that the class is a part of the combined division. The user can individually change/edit the names of the classes in combined division as well.

**NOTE**: The entry verification process will use the **original class rules** for the combined classes.

The same privilege is used for Combine and Uncombined Classes and Divisions.
